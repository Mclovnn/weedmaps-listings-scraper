Title: Python Scraper for retail listing info

Description:

Need python based scraper that will allow me to scrape a website for specific content on every retail listing. Need data on all California locations ASAP(~2500) and then there is some time to develop the scraper to get data from the other regions.
I am attaching a python file for reference that used to work, but is no longer functional. I am attaching a csv file showing the exact output required for each retail location scraped.
I am also attaching a PNG file showing where this data gets rendered/presented on the website listing - and identify the corresponding column the values belong to.
Here is a page for the shop index: https://weedmaps.com/listings/in/united-states/united-states/california
Can limit with filter for only the following Business Type: Storefronts, Delivery, Recreational, Medical
*** This site uses PerimeterX and possibly other anti scraping methods (rate limiting, etc.) that make it a bit more challenging than most sites. Need scraper to have ability to bypass this with minimal interaction, ideally zero interaction. Do not bid without understanding challenges of this.
